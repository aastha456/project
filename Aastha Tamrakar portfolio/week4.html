    <hr>
    <p>Git is an open-source distributed version control system developed by Linus Torvalds in 2005. Its emphasis on speed and data integrity in which there is no centralized connectivity is needed. It is powerful and cheap branching with easy merge in which each developer has his repository and have a local copy in which they can change history. It supports non-linear development branches and applications with a large number of codes files. <br>
        Apache Subversion is an open-source software version and revision control system under the Apache license. It managed files and folders that are present in the repository. It can operate across the network, which allows it and used by people on different computer .we can say that a repository is like an ordinary file server which allows it to be used by people on a different computer.<br>
    Below the table is the difference between GIT and SVN:
    <table style="width:100%">
        <tr>
          <td>GIT</td>
          <td>SVN</td>
        </tr>

          <td>Git is open source distributed vice control system developed by Linus Torvalds in 2005. It emphasis on speed and data integrity.</td>
          <td>Apache Subversion is an open source software version and revision control system under Apache license.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Git has a Distributed Model.</td>
          <td>SVN has a Centralized Model.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>In git every user has their own copy of code on their local like their own branch.</td>
          <td>In SVN there is central repository has working copy that also make changes and committed in central repository.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>In git we do not required any Network to perform git operation.  </td>
          <td>In SVN we required Network for runs the SVN operation. </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Git is more difficult to learn. It has more concepts and commands. </td>
          <td>SVN is much easier to learn as compared to git.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Git deals with large number of files like binary files that change quickly that why it become slow.</td>
          <td>SVN control the large number of binary files easily.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>In git we create only .git directory.</td>
          <td>In SVN we create .svn directory in each folder.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>It does not have good UI as compared to SVN.</td>
          <td>SVN has simple and better user interface .</td>

<h1 style="color:black;font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">What are wireframes?</h1>
<hr>
<p>A wireframe is a schematic or blueprint that is useful for helping you, your programmers and designers think and communicate about the structure of the software or website you're building.</p>

<hr>
<h2 style="color:black;font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Why use wireframes?</h2>
<hr>
<p>The same screen can be built in a lot of different ways, but only a few of them will get your message across correctly and result in an easy-to-use software or website. Nailing down a good interface structure is possibly the most important part of designing software.<br>
    Doing this work now, before any code is written and before the visual design is finalized, will save you lots of time and painful adjustment work later. For more information about why people choose to wireframe, read about The Two Phases of Wireframing, or watch our detailed Wireframing for Newbies video or the quick summary below.<br>

<h2 style="color:black;font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Why do wireframes look the way they do?</h2>
<hr>
<ul>
    <li>Wireframes make it clear that this is not the final design</li>
    <p>No one could mistake a wireframe for the final look and feel of your application. Low-fidelity and few colors force you to focus on structure over details. There will be lots of time for visual design once the structure is finalized.</p>
    <li>Wireframes convey that "this is all up for discussion"</li>
    <p>The rough feel encourages discussion. We call it a look no one is afraid to criticize. Wireframes are really quick to make, so don't be shy with giving feedback! Each screen probably only took a few minutes to make; don't worry, their author won't mind doing them over from scratch. What matters the most at this point is the final ease of use, so going through a few iterations is normal and expected.</p>
    <li>Wireframes make it clear that no code has been written yet</li>
    <p>If your customer or stakeholder received some screens that looked like screenshots of the final app, instead of a wireframe, they might assume that all the code behind those screenshots had already been written. This is most often not the case. Wireframes don't have this danger.</p>
</ul>

<hr>
<p>When you’re creating pretty much anything, it’s common practice to start with a draft. Drafts help you work out the kinks before sending your creation out into the world.<br><br>

    If you’ve drafted a design or worked on a product, you’ve probably heard the terms wireframe, mockup or prototype. You might think they all sound quite similar — but there are some important differences. In this article, we’ll compare wireframes vs mockups vs prototypes, how they’re different, and when to use each.</p>
<hr>
<h1 style="color:black;font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Wireframe vs mockup vs prototype</h1>
<hr>
<p>Before we get to the detailed comparison between wireframes, mockups and prototypes, let’s look at the basic definitions of all three.<br><br>

    Wireframe: A wireframe is a blueprint or schematic that helps communicate the structure of your app or website to the relevant stakeholders.<br><br>
    
    Mockup: A mockup is a high-fidelity render of your design that showcases how the finished product will look.<br><br>
    
    Prototype: A prototype is an early model of a product that focuses on functionality and gives your stakeholders a taste of the final version.<br><br>
